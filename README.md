# Finance-Calculator

**Investment or Bond Calculator**

> The user is allowed to either choose which calculation they want to do.
> The User will have a choice between an investment calculator and a bond calculator.

**User Inputs Investment**
1. The amount of money that they are depositing.
2. The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number of the interest rate should be entered — no need to worry about having to deal with the added ‘%’,
3. The number of years they plan on investing for.
4. Then ask the user to input whether they want “simple”
or “compound” interest, and store this in a variable called interest. 

**User Inputs Bond**
1. The present value of the house.
2. The interest rate.
3. The number of months they plan to take to repay the
bond.
